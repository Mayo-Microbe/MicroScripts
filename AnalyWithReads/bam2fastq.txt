# When data is placed in the archive, it is stored as a bam file.  We can only do analysis on fastq files,
# so we need to convert the stored bam file in the archive back to fastq data.
# to do this we use samtools bam2fq

$ samtools bam2fq <SAMPLE.bam> > <SAMPLE.fastq>

#This WILL NOT compress the file, you probably want to do that for space, so do this instead:
$ samtools bam2fq <SAMPLE.bam> | bgzip > <SAMPLE.fastq.gz>
