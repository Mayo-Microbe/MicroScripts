# When data is placed in the archive, it is stored as a bam file.  We can only do analysis on fastq files,
# so we need to convert the stored bam file in the archive back to fastq data.
# to do this we use samtools bam2fq

$ samtools bam2fq <SAMPLE.bam> > <SAMPLE.fastq>

#This WILL NOT compress the file, you probably want to do that for space, so do this instead:
$ samtools bam2fq <SAMPLE.bam> | bgzip > <SAMPLE.fastq.gz>

# To split the reads (forward/reverse) and compress, use this command line:
$  samtools bam2fq -1 BTP_124-MP.FC000000000-AH8BH_L1_R1_ICTTGTA.fastq.gz -2 BTP_124-MP.FC000000000-AH8BH_L1_R2_ICTTGTA.fastq.gz BTP_124-MP.FC000000000-AH8BH_L1_IACAGTG.bam
