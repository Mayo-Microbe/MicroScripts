# To access next generation sequencing data (.bam files) in the delivery area

# Change directory to the location where you want to move the archive data (make sure you have write access to the directory), then:

$ ftp research-archive

# Enter mfad\<username> on prompt

# Enter password on prompt

$ cd /data2/delivery/Patel_Robin_rxp04/<RUN_ID>/primary

# where <RUN_ID> is something like 151229_M00710_0086_000000000-AH8BH 

# note that when you are in ftp, you can use local commands (e.g. pwd) by escaping them with a !
$ !pwd
$ !ls

$ mget $<filename.bam>

# alternatively and for multiple files:

$ mget *.bam

# .bam files will be moved to the current (non-FTP) directory

# To exit the FTP:

$ exit

#### sometimes FTP is just a big pain... try investigating the following other commands:
$ lftp
