# Directories:
# File and directory paths in UNIX use the forward slash "/" to separate directory names in a path.
# examples:
$ /              "root" directory
$ /usr           directory usr (sub-directory of / "root" directory)
$ /usr/STRIM100  STRIM100 is a subdirectory of /usr

# Moving around the file system:
$ pwd               Show the "present working directory", or current directory. Tell me where I currently am!
$ cd                Change current directory to your HOME directory.
$ cd /some/other    Change current directory to /some/other.
$ cd INIT           Change current directory to INIT which is a sub-directory of the current 
                        directory.
$ cd ..             Change current directory to the parent directory of the current directory.
$ cd $STRMWORK      Change current directory to the directory defined by the environment 
                        variable 'STRMWORK'.
$ cd ~bob           Change the current directory to the user bob's home directory (if you have permission).
# change to the last directory I was in:
$ cd -

# Listing directory contents:
$ ls    list a directory
$ ls -l    list a directory in long ( detailed ) format
# for example:
$ ls -l

ls -a        List the current directory including hidden files. Hidden files start 
             with "." 
ls -ld *     List all the file and directory names in the current directory using 
             long format. Without the "d" option, ls would list the contents 
             of any sub-directory of the current. With the "d" option, ls 
             just lists them like regular files.
# show an extended list of the files where I am:
$ ls -al

# Looking for help: The man and apropos commands

# Most of the commands have a manual page which give sometimes useful, often more or less 
  detailed, sometimes cryptic and unfathomable discriptions of their usage. Some say they 
  are called man pages because they are only for real men. 

# Example:

$ man ls      Shows the manual page for the ls command

# You can search through the man pages using apropos

# Example:

$ apropos build     Shows a list of all the man pages whose discriptions contain the word "build"

# Do a man apropos for detailed help on apropos.

# show the history of commands I have used:
$ history

# Arrrow up / Arrow down, to go up or down in the commands we have used in the past
# when typing is just 'too much'
